# Trax Web Development Home Assignment

### Thank you for your interest in Trax!

We'd like to get to know you a little better and see how your web development skills shine!

In order to do that, we have a small home assignment. There is no time limit and the requirements are very fluid.
You can decide the best way possible to complete the challenge.


### The Challenge
Create a web application (full stack) that does the following:
- Displays a list of UK cities along with the current weather in each city.
- The list should initially be sorted by city population size, but with an option to instead sort by current temperature.
- When clicking on a city, a map of the city location should be displayed, along with the weather forecast for the next 5 days.
- It should be easy to find a specific city in the list.

**The implementation of the solution is completely up to you**. The only constraint is you should use a JavaScript based front-end and back-end stack. Our current stack is **Node.js with Express/NestJS** on the back-end and **Angular** on the front-end along with **Lit Elements** and lots of other buzz words and technologies.

### Recommendations

Its recommended that your solution be:
- Maintainable: to allow for easy changes
- Scaleable: what if millions of users are using the web application?
- Reusable: perhaps we might want to make some parts of the application available elsewhere
- User Friendly: consider UI/UX - across the whole stack

**Feel free to let us know any questions or comments you have.**

### Finished?

Upon completion, upload your full solution to a GitHub repo, along with instructions of how to run locally. Include any other relevant information related to your app. Send us a link and after review we will contact you with our feedback.


## Good Luck!
